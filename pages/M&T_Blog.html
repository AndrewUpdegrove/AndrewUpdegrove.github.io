      <div class="postTitle">Week of 1/20: Computer Music Research</div>
      <div class="postContent">
        This week I looked over some papers that caguth my eye were a paper about <a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/i/icmc/bbp2372.2018.018/--coding-with-a-piano-the-first-phase-of-the-codeklaviers?view=image" target="_blank">Coding with a Piano</a>. I was able to find a video of one of the demonstrations of it. The idea is very interesting, and the fact that our classroom has a midi piano in it makes me think that there is potential for pursuing something along these lines. I also found this paper on <a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/i/icmc/bbp2372.2014.015/--computer-game-piece-exploring-video-games-as-means-for?view=image" target="_blank">Using Video Games as a method of Improvization</a> which got me thinking about designing an instrument around the use of a controller. The joysticks make me think of a way to a fun synth modulator. I would have to think further on it.
        Beyond the pure coding aspects the idea of building a physical electronic instrument interests me greatly. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaW5K85UDR0" target="_blank">The Modulin</a> made by Martin Molin really fascinates me. The instrument takes its name from a modular syntesizer played sort of like a violin. I find systems like this incredibly fascinating.

        In response to augmented instruments discussed in class on 1/23, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGVUKvYG8-k">A guitar with built in audio effects.</a>

        First post for the class. In class on Monday I mentioned that I was thinking about doing something related to modifying live perfomance, and said the name Jacob Collier. One of his interesting live performances was a for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZoGcQVjJg" target="_blank">TED Talk</a> in which he loops in quite astounding ways. Another aspect of his live performance is the use of a live prismizer sound effect. He has one of his keyboards running a version of the Prismizer vocal effect or vocoder. Manipulating a live performance in this way has alway been very interesting to me.
