      <div class="postTitle">Week of 1/27: My Project Concept</div>
      <div class="postContent">
        My project I will be working on for the semester will be slightly different then the stuff I have been exploring. The idea for my project comes from the album "Voice Notes" by Charlie Puth. He titled the album as such because if he had an idea for a song, melody, or lyrics, he would sing it into the voicenotes app on his iPhone. So I thought, what if there was a more fleshed out version of that. An app for musicians to sing or play ideas into an app on their phone for later. I am still deciding on the full capability of the application. I would like to have the app identify the pitches and transcribe it into a rhythmic schema identified by the user and then allow for midi, or original playback. The midi playback would allow for the user to record in multiple lines and then specify instruments and see how the sound together on the fly.
        I have decided to work in c++, and I will be putting all my coding work into this <a href="https://github.com/AndrewUpdegrove/voice_scoring" target="_blank">github repo</a> so that anyone can see what I am working on. I do not have a good name for the app yet, so if anyone has any suggestions that would be cool. I am still deciding on what audio package to use, right now I am deciding between SuperPowered SDK and The Synthesis Tookit.

      <div class="postTitle">Week of 1/20: Computer Music Research</div>
      <div class="postContent">
        This week I looked over some papers that caguth my eye were a paper about <a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/i/icmc/bbp2372.2018.018/--coding-with-a-piano-the-first-phase-of-the-codeklaviers?view=image" target="_blank">Coding with a Piano</a>. I was able to find a video of one of the demonstrations of it. The idea is very interesting, and the fact that our classroom has a midi piano in it makes me think that there is potential for pursuing something along these lines. I also found this paper on <a href="https://quod.lib.umich.edu/i/icmc/bbp2372.2014.015/--computer-game-piece-exploring-video-games-as-means-for?view=image" target="_blank">Using Video Games as a method of Improvization</a> which got me thinking about designing an instrument around the use of a controller. The joysticks make me think of a way to a fun synth modulator. I would have to think further on it.
        Beyond the pure coding aspects the idea of building a physical electronic instrument interests me greatly. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QaW5K85UDR0" target="_blank">The Modulin</a> made by Martin Molin really fascinates me. The instrument takes its name from a modular syntesizer played sort of like a violin. I find systems like this incredibly fascinating.

      <div class="postContent">
        First post for the class. In class on Monday I mentioned that I was thinking about doing something related to modifying live perfomance, and said the name Jacob Collier. One of his interesting live performances was a for a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDZoGcQVjJg" target="_blank">TED Talk</a> in which he loops in quite astounding ways. Another aspect of his live performance is the use of a live prismizer sound effect. He has one of his keyboards running a version of the Prismizer vocal effect or vocoder. Manipulating a live performance in this way has alway been very interesting to me.
